# Caesar_Cipher

This is a basic Caesar Cipher script that allows you to shift the letters in a phrase by any key 0-25. 
I have also included a script to decrypt messages without the key. 

Now with commandline options! 
	
	-k for key
	-m for phrase

Added less feature-packed versions in Rust and Swift for your amusement. 

## Gem Dependencies for the Ruby Version:
